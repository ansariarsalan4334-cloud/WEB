# AL BEAST — Fast Food Website

A simple, responsive static website for a fast food shop (fried rice, burgers, pizza, momos, etc.). Drop these files into a folder and open `web.html` in your browser.

Files:
- web.html — main page
- web.css — styling
- web.js — interactive behavior (menu filters, modal order form, contact form)

How to run:
1. Save the three files into the same folder.
2. Open `web.html` in Chrome/Firefox/Edge (double-click or right-click -> Open with...).
3. To test ordering, click any "Order" button — a modal will open with a simulated submission.

Customize:
- Replace images by editing the `src` attribute of `<img>` tags in `web.html`.
- Change prices and menu items by editing the menu cards.
- Connect the forms to a real backend by replacing the simulated setTimeout logic in `script.js` with fetch/XHR calls to your server.
